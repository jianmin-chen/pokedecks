## Pokedecks

Build and track your [Pokemon TCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game) decks! Written with Next.js, Mongoose, a bit of Tailwind CSS, and a lot of [Simon Goellner's `pokemon-cards-css`](https://github.com/simeydotme/pokemon-cards-css). Possibly being turned into a [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) [workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com)!

The design is inspired by [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/21613293-Articles-Deck-List-Widget).
